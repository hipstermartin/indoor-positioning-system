# Indoor Positioning System

## Overview

This project is an end-to-end working prototype of an indoor positioning system that uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons to provide location-based services inside buildings. The app was developed using Android Studio.

GPS technology is commonly used to track the position of an object or person. However, GPS signals do not penetrate physical barriers, which makes it ineffective for indoor tracking applications. This is where indoor positioning systems come in. Our project implements an indoor positioning application using BLE beacons to provide accurate location-based services inside buildings.

## Features

- Accurate indoor positioning using BLE beacons
- Real-time location tracking
- Interactive indoor maps
- Customizable alerts and notifications
- User-friendly interface
- Integration with existing systems

## Technologies

- Android Studio
- Java
- BLE Beacons
- Indoor Positioning Algorithms

## Installation

To use our indoor positioning system, you will need to have an Android device that supports BLE. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Build and run the app on your Android device
4. Place BLE beacons at strategic locations inside the building
5. Allow the app to detect the beacons and calibrate the system
6. Start using the indoor positioning system!
